# Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning
1. Project Overview
This project aims to predict stock prices using various Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques on four distinct datasets, representing different companies' stock data. We focus on analyzing patterns and trends to forecast future stock prices, providing valuable insights for investors and analysts.

Companies Included:
FPT Corporation (FPT)
Masan Group (MSN)
Phú Nhuận Jewelry (PNJ)
Vingroup (VIC)
Main Objectives:
Build predictive models for stock prices based on historical data.
Compare the performance of ML and DL models.
Provide visualizations and insights from the results.
2. Datasets
The project utilizes stock data from 4 companies (FPT, MSN, PNJ, VIC) which have been pre-processed and merged into a single DataFrame for unified analysis. The dataset includes:

Date
Open, High, Low, Close prices
Volume traded
3. Requirements
Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
